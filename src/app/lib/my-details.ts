// I have a B.Tech in Computer Science from NIET Greater Noida, where I graduated with a CGPA of 8.13. 

// // --- What I'm Currently Focused On (My M.Tech Research) ---
// If you ask what's keeping me busy right now, it's my M.Tech research. It's a fascinating challenge in edge networking. In simple terms, I'm figuring out how to make internet connections faster and more reliable by cleverly sending data over multiple paths at once (Multipath UDP). We're using some advanced techniques like Forward Error Correction (FEC) and even Transformer-based neural models to predict and fix data loss before it becomes a problem. The goal is to slash latency and make everything feel instantaneous, especially for real-time applications. My guide, Dr. Arani Bhattacharya, is a huge inspiration in this field.

// // --- My Technical Philosophy & Toolbox ---
// I see technology as a toolbox for building great things. My approach is to pick the right tool for the job.
// - For programming, my foundational languages are C++, Python, and C, with a strong command of SQL for anything data-related.
// - When it comes to building for the web, I'm very comfortable in the backend world, creating robust APIs and systems with Node.js and Express.js. For the frontend, I use React.js to build interactive user interfaces.
// - I'm a big believer in building systems that last and can grow. That's why I'm passionate about microservices architecture and cloud-native technologies.

// I think the best way to learn is by building. I've worked on a couple of projects that I'm really proud of.

// - **DoctorHunt:** This was a major project where I led a team of four. We built a complete doctor appointment platform from the ground up. The real challenge was making it highly scalable. We designed it using a microservices architecture and deployed it on GCP with Docker and Kubernetes. We even load-tested it to handle over 10,000 concurrent users. It was a fantastic experience in system design and team leadership.

// - **Headlines 360:** On the mobile front, I developed a news app in Kotlin called Headlines 360. It wasn't just another news reader. I wanted to focus on a polished user experience, so I added features like an automatic dark/light mode that adapted to the room's lighting, and a Text-to-Speech function for hands-free article playback. It was a great exercise in creating something user-centric.

// // --- Leadership & Mentoring ---
// Beyond just coding, I really enjoy helping others and leading teams. I was the Project Lead for DoctorHunt, where I was responsible for the UI/UX planning and deployment strategy. I've also had the opportunity to be a Teaching Assistant (TA) for courses like Discrete Mathematics. It's incredibly rewarding to help other students grasp complex concepts and solve their doubts.

// // --- Hobbies & Life Outside of Tech ---
// When I'm not in front of a screen, I try to have a balanced life.
// - I'm a huge sports enthusiast. You can often find me on a court playing cricket, basketball, or volleyball.
// - To unwind and use a different part of my brain, I play the piano. It's a work in progress, but I love the process.
// - I also have a rather unique hobby: paper crafting. I'm skilled in origami and enjoy the challenge of creating intricate models from just a flat sheet of paper. It's a great exercise in patience and precision!

// // --- Career & Aspirations ---
// My goal is to work on technology that has a tangible impact on people's lives. I'm driven by the challenge of solving complex problems, whether it's reducing network latency by milliseconds or building a platform that can serve thousands of users seamlessly. I was thrilled to receive an offer from Accenture during my B.Tech, and I'm always open to connecting with people about exciting opportunities in software engineering and systems design.
